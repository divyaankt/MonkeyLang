# Monkey - A toy, interpreted programming language, implemented in Go
This is the implementation for the Monkey language interpreter, implemented in Go. It follows the book, "Writing an Interpreter in Go", by Thorsten Ball.
## To run the interpreter
Download the source code, cd into the directory and type
### go run main.go
In future, Monkey would be compiled language and it would follow this same code as the baseline. It will follow the book, "Writing an Compiler in Go", by Thorsten Ball.
